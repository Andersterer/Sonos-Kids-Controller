// Allow multiple files like these in a folder and merge the arrays to a big one in server.js
// Then in the client create an array with all artists
// in the subview show a filtered list of all titles that match the artist name
// howto read multiple files from folder:
// https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52680107/node-js-output-content-from-multiple-json-files-into-console
// For the artist images create an artist-images.json in a different folder with objects just artist and image

// If an artist has only one title, open player directly instead of the albums subview
// also use the album cover instead of looking for an artist image
